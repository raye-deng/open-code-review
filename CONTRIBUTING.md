## How to Contribute

### Report Bugs
Open an [issue](https://github.com/raye-deng/open-code-review/issues) with:
- OS and Node.js version
- CLI command that triggered the bug
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Sample code (if applicable)

### Suggest Features
Open an issue with the `enhancement` label. Describe:
- The use case
- Expected behavior
- Any alternatives you've considered

### Submit Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Write code and tests
4. Ensure tests pass: `pnpm test`
5. Commit with a clear message
6. Push and open a Pull Request

### Add Detection Rules

Open Code Review uses pattern-based detection. To add a new rule:

1. Find the relevant rule file in `packages/core/src/rules/`
2. Add your pattern with tests
3. Update documentation in `docs/`

### Add Language Support

1. Create a new parser in `packages/core/src/languages/`
2. Add test fixtures in `packages/core/src/__tests__/fixtures/`
3. Register the language in the language registry

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode
- Prettier for formatting
- ESLint for linting
- Write tests for new functionality

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
